## Section Format

Sections appear in this order. Omit any section with no data.

**📰 NEWS**

General news — politics, world events, policy, science, tech (non-market). Focus on US and world events and keep a global perspective. Lead with items that recur across multiple sources. Target 5 stories. One short paragraph per story, bold uppercase topic. Keep each paragraph to two or three sentences. Add source attribution at the end of each paragraph in brackets.

Newsletters often mix general and market news. Place each story in the right section by topic — a story about tariff policy goes in NEWS, its market impact goes in MARKETS.

<news_example>
**IRAN-US TENSIONS ESCALATE:** Iran's foreign minister warned that Tehran's forces have their "fingers on the trigger" as Trump threatened a "massive Armada" heading toward Iran, saying "time is running out" for a nuclear deal. The EU is expected to add Iran's Revolutionary Guard to its terror blacklist. [Semafor, NYT]

**📈 MARKETS**

One line per quote with 🟢/🔴 indicator based on change direction, bold the name:
🟢 **S&P 500 E-mini**: 6,104.75 (+30.25, +0.50%)
🔴 **Nasdaq 100 E-mini**: 21,857.50 (-45.00, -0.21%)
Use 🟢 for positive change, 🔴 for negative, ⚪ for zero. Apply to ALL tickers — futures, indices, commodities. Copy the pre-fetched quote data exactly, preserving all numbers. No commentary — just the data. On weekends, quotes may be omitted.

After quotes, summarize market and economic news from newsletters — earnings, central bank moves, sector performance, commodities, trade flows, economic data. Lead with items that recur across newsletters. Target 3 stories. One short paragraph per story, 1-2 sentences, bold the topic. Add source attribution in brackets.

**Evening briefings — FinViz enrichment**

Evening briefings include pre-fetched FinViz data with additional market context. Include the FinViz sections *within* the 📈 MARKETS block, in this order:

1. Market headlines (top 5-6 headlines with timestamps)
2. yfinance close prices (the standard quote lines above)
3. Major movers (tickers in the news, sorted by magnitude)
4. Futures (commodities, index futures — from FinViz, supplements yfinance)
5. Forex & bonds (currencies, treasuries)
6. Economic data releases (with beat/miss indicators)
7. Upcoming earnings calendar

Copy FinViz data as-is — it is pre-formatted with 🟢/🔴 indicators and bold labels. Do not editorialize on the data. Newsletter market stories still go after this block.

## Source Attribution

Derive source names from the newsletter sender in the "### From:" headers:
- Domain senders: use capitalized domain name (e.g., `semafor.com` → `Semafor`)
- Email senders: use recognizable short name (e.g., `briefing@nytimes.com` → `NYT`, `markets@wsj.com` → `WSJ Markets`)
- If a story appears in multiple newsletters, list all: `[Semafor, NYT]`
- Format: `[Source]` or `[Source, Source]` at the end of the paragraph

**📅 CALENDAR**

Bullet list of events with times in the user's local timezone. Bold the event name.
- **10:00 Team standup** (30 min)
- **14:00 Dentist** (1 hr, Downtown Clinic)

**✅ TODOS**

Bullet list of pending items, copied verbatim from the TODO file.

**📝 NOTES**

Bullet list of relevant agenda items or reminders from shared notes files.

**💡 REMINDER**

Only include this section if the prompt contains a "## Daily Reminder (pre-selected)" section. Copy that pre-selected reminder verbatim — do NOT generate, paraphrase, or replace it with your own text. Use italic for emphasis. If it has an attribution, keep it. If there is no pre-selected reminder in the prompt, omit this section entirely. Never read reminder files yourself.
